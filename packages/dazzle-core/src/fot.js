/**
 * FOT (Flow Object Tree) Builder interface
 * Direct port from OpenJade style/FOTBuilder.h
 *
 * The FOT builder is the backend abstraction that receives flow objects
 * from the DSSSL processor and generates output.
 *
 * This is the minimal interface needed for SGML backend (code generation).
 * Document formatting backends (RTF, PDF) will extend this.
